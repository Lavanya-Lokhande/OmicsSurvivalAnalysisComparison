# Feature Specific survival analysis
Comparison of feature-specific survival analysis models for multi-sampled omics data

Problem - 
Spatial Omics data collected from - 
- multiple cell types
- and multiple spatial regions
- from FFPE tissues belongng to a patient cohort
- with multiple sampling per patient

Objective - 
Identify cell-specific features of interest that has prognostic implications in terms of patient survival or disease progression, keeping in mind that expression data has replicates and cells are classified based on tissue-asscoiated regions
